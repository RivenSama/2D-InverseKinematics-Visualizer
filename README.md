# 2D-IK- Visualizer - PROTOTYPE

## This project is a protoype created with the scope to discover inverse kinematics

<p> It is a simple 2d visualizer of a 3 segment arm, collisions or angle limits are not implemented as it is not the purpose of this project
  This 2d visualizer is very basic. Yet it will be the foundation of a much bigger project, involving AR.
